# NYC Subway-Weighted Projection

This project generates a subway-access weighted map of New York City as an SVG.

The script:
- uses official borough boundaries from NYC Open Data
- uses official MTA GTFS subway route shapes and station locations
- draws official subway route colors from the GTFS `route_color` field
- adds major streets and larger parks/open spaces to the basemap
- approximates walking distance as straight-line distance times a circuity factor
- expands the map where subway access is stronger and compresses it where access is weaker

Run:

```bash
python3 generate_nyc_subway_weighted_projection.py
```

Output:

```text
output/nyc_subway_weighted_projection.svg
```

Interactive website:

```bash
python3 build_commute_site_data.py
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

This repo includes:
- [wrangler.jsonc](/Users/primaryuser/Desktop/nyc-projection/wrangler.jsonc) to upload the `site/` directory as static assets
- [src/worker.js](/Users/primaryuser/Desktop/nyc-projection/src/worker.js) to serve the site from the `/nyc-transit-time-map` path prefix on `castrio.me`

Notes:
- The map now uses a single shared geographic projection for boroughs, stations, route shapes, parks, and streets so transit layers stay aligned to the basemap.
- Because people enter the subway at stations, the weighting is based on distance to the nearest station complex rather than track geometry alone.
- The warp is a lightweight cumulative-density transform, not a formal cartogram solver.
- The interactive prototype estimates commute time using MTA GTFS subway travel times plus short walking access to and from stations.
- Borough labels are placed from each borough's largest polygon so the output stays stable for fragmented multi-island geometries.
- You can tune the static SVG warp in [generate_nyc_subway_weighted_projection.py](/Users/primaryuser/Desktop/nyc-projection/generate_nyc_subway_weighted_projection.py) and the website data build in [build_commute_site_data.py](/Users/primaryuser/Desktop/nyc-projection/build_commute_site_data.py).
